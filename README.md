Path Visualizer Project built using React and Boostrap to visualize the following shortest path algorithms:-

- Dijsktra's Algorithm
- Breadth First Search Algorithm
- Best First Search Algorithm
- Depth First Search Algorithm
- A\* Algorithm

To create the maze **Recursive Division** algorithm is used
